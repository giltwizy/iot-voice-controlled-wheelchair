# voice-control-arduino-code-for-2-motors

In this project we can achieve controlling 2 Dc motors by the use of Voice Control by receiving commands from the Google Speech API that transmits the word via a bluetooth connection made between an Android device to the Bluetooth Module (HC-05).
Once the specific command is received by the Bluetooth module the string is sent to the arduino thus when it is recognized it sends the signal to the motor pins needed to either be ON or OFF.

  In my case i have applied this concept to create a Voice Controlled Wheelchair.The Following are the components used:-

1)Breadboard

2)LCD IC2

3)2 DC motors

4)Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04

5)Buzzer

6)Wheelchair Chasis

7)Printed Circuit Board

8)Arduino Nano(Any Arduino Works)

9)Power Source (9 Volts)
